# EcommerceCustomerChurnAnalysis
This project presents a comprehensive SQL-based data analytics pipeline for performing customer churn analysis on e-commerce data. It covers the entire workflow from database creation and raw data import, through data cleaning and feature engineering, to in-depth business intelligence queries revealing key churn drivers.
# Ecommerce Customer Churn Analysis Using MySQL

##  Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete customer churn analysis workflow for a fictional e-commerce platform using MySQL. It covers **data cleaning, feature engineering, and advanced business analytics** through detailed SQL queries applied on customer transactional and demographic data.

**Goal:**  
- Identify key factors influencing customer churn  
- Extract actionable business insights for retention  
- Prepare data for future predictive modeling (e.g., machine learning)

***

##  Project Workflow

### 1. Database & Table Setup
- Created a dedicated MySQL database `EcommerceChurnDB` with a detailed table schema for storing customer, transaction, and churn-related data.

### 2. Data Import
- Imported the CSV dataset (`ecommerce_churn.csv`) using MySQL Workbench‚Äôs Table Data Import Wizard into the predefined `ecommercechurn` table, ensuring data integrity.

### 3. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values by replacing nulls with column averages.
- Standardized categorical text fields for consistency.
- Corrected data entry errors and fixed outliers.
- Added user-friendly labels for churn status and complaints.

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Created categorical "buckets" for warehouse distance, tenure range, and cashback amount to facilitate better segmentation and machine learning feature preparation.

### 5. Business Analytics & Insights
- Launched 17 key analytical SQL queries to uncover trends and relationships related to churn, including device usage, city tier, tenure, payment modes, customer complaints, and more.
- These insights help guide marketing, customer retention, and business strategy.
